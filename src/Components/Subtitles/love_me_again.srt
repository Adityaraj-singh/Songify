1
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,199
Know I have done wrong‚
left your heart torn

2
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:21,206
Is that what devils do?

3
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:24,811
Took you so long‚ where
only fools gone

4
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:28,714
I shook the angel in you!

5
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:32,617
Now I am rising from the crowd

6
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:36,316
Rising up to you!

7
00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:40,205
Feel with all the strength I found

8
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:48,406
There′s nothing I can′t do!

9
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:54,705
I need to know now‚ know now

10
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:56,808
Can you love me again?

11
00:00:57,012 --> 00:01:02,111

12
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,414
Can you love me again?

Can you love me again?

18
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,508
It is unforgivable

19
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,409
I stole and burnt your soul

20
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:35,310
Is that what demons do?

21
00:01:35,506 --> 00:01:37,105
They rule the worst in me

22
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:39,010
Destroy everything

23
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:42,511
They blame on angels like you

24
00:01:42,717 --> 00:01:46,816
Now I am rising from the ground

25
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:50,603
Rising up to you!

26
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:54,310
Filled with all the strength I found

27
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:59,705

00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:49,117
Told you once I can′t do this again

00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:52,912
Do this again!

35
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:56,807
I told you once I can′t do this again

36
00:02:57,017 --> 00:03:05,016
Do this again!
