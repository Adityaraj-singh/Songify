00:00:16,707 --> 00:00:21,706
Oh‚ hush‚ my dear‚ It is
been a difficult year


00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:27,803
And terrors don′t prey
on innocent victims


00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:34,416
Trust me‚ darlin′‚ trust me darlin′


00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:40,501
It is been a loveless year


00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,208
I am a man of three fears


00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:48,917
Integrity‚ faith‚ and crocodile tears


00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:55,400
Trust me‚ darlin′‚ trust me‚ darlin′

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,599
So look me in the eyes (Eyes)‚ tell
me what you see (You see)

00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:09,106
Perfect paradise (Dise)‚ tearin′
at the seams (Seams)


00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:14,411
I wish I could escape it (Escape)‚
I don′t wanna fake it
