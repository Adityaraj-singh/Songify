0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perfect

1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,399
I might never be your knight
in shining armor

2
00:00:09,613 --> 00:00:14,812
I might never be the one you
take home to mother

3
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:19,613
And I might never be the one
who brings you flowers

4
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,910
But I can be the one‚
be the one tonight

5
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:26,201
When I first saw you

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,800
From across the room

7
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:33,911
I could tell that you were curious

8
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:36,102
Girl‚ I hope You are sure

9
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,515
What You are looking for

10
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:41,602
′Cause I am not good
at making promises

11
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:47,111
But if you like causing trouble
up in hotel rooms

12
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:52,014
And if you like having
secret le rendezvous

13
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:56,917
If you like to do the things you
know that we shouldn′t do

14
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:59,312
Baby‚ I am perfect

15
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:01,613
Baby‚ I am perfect for you

16
00:01:01,803 --> 00:01:06,402
And if you like midnight driving
with the windows down

17
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:11,117
And if you like going places
we can′t even pronounce

18
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:16,004
If you like to do whatever You
have been dreaming about

19
00:01:16,218 --> 00:01:18,717
Baby‚ You are perfect

20
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:20,616
Baby‚ You are perfect

21
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:24,015
So let′s start right now

22
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:29,016
I might never be the hand
you put your heart in

23
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:33,817
Or the arms that hold you
any time you want them

24
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:38,402
But that don′t mean that we can′t
live here in the moment

25
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:42,905
′Cause I can be the one you
love from time to time

26
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,718
When I first saw you

27
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:48,107
From across the room

28
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:53,204
I could tell that you were curious

29
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,405
Girl‚ I hope You are sure

30
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:57,710
What You are looking for

31
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:01,713
Cause I am not good at making promises

32
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:06,502
But if you like causing trouble
up in hotel rooms

33
00:02:06,704 --> 00:02:11,003

And if you like cameras flashing
every time we go out

44
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:57,111
And if You are looking for someone to
write your breakup songs about

45
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,210
